Few Points I like to mention:

1. All the district data of singapore and their corresponding polygons(which are copyright of 99.co) are present in data.js file. Digging out this data was part of assignment and it is done using [**99.co**](http://99.co) website

2. District Polygon data can also be fetch through API Calls

3. I have used Backbone.js framework as I have worked on it earlier.


Working of the Assignment:

1. On selecting any district from the left section, it will display the corresponding polygon on the map and will fetch some nearby restaurants in that region using **Place Search** feature of **Google Map API**

2. On de-selecting any district, corresponding polygon and markers will be removed from the map
