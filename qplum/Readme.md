This contains the assignment given by [qplum.co](https://www.qplum.co).

Few Points I like to mention:

1. It is more of a UI kind of assignment and does not contain JS functionality.

2. All the data of strategies which is shown is present in data.js file. I use a function to retreive the data which can be changed to an appropriate AJAX call.

3. I have used Angular.js framework.


Working of the Assignment:

1. The webpage shows all the strategies according to the new design given.

2. Infinite scrolling functionality is implemented. It loads 15 strategy at a time.

3. The site is responsive and will look as desired on Mobile, Tablet and Desktop.

4. Labels of a given strategy like Assets and Benchmark are grouped before they are shown.
